                    It is composed of the President and the Vice President who
                    are elected by direct popular vote and serve a term of six years.
                    The Constitution grants the President authority to appoint his Cabinet.
                    These departments form a large portion of the countryâ€™s bureaucracy.

                    It holds the power to settle controversies
                    involving rights that are legally demandable and enforceable.
                    This branch determines whether or not there has been a
                    grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
                    jurisdiction on the part and instrumentality of the government.
                    It is made up of a Supreme Court and lower courts.
